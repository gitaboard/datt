## What is DATT (Do All The Things)
DATT is a simple personal Kanban board for your GitHub profile.  You can see a single board with all of your issues that are spread across multiple repositories in a "Standup" type model: What I did yesterday, What I am doing today, What I working on tomorrow, and my blockers.

## Stack
I am using this project as a way to learn [Meteor JS](https://www.meteor.com/).  There is already a GitHub Node.js OAuth module that we will integrate through Meteor authentication API.  I will list dependencies as we come across them.  Right now this is a barebones meteor generated application.  I hope to work on this over the next few weeks.

## Install Meteor
[Installation Instructions Here!](https://www.meteor.com/install)

## Goals
Eventually I would like to see this as an [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application that is cross platform deployable.
